# Homework Question:
#
# You are given a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a student and their scoresin different subjects.
#
# Student Data:
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "scores": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78}},
    {"name": "Bob", "scores": {"Math": 70, "Science": 88, "English": 82}},
    {"name": "Charlie", "scores": {"Math": 92, "Science": 81, "English": 89}},
    {"name": "David", "scores": {"Math": 60, "Science": 75, "English": 80}}
]
#Write a Python program that:
# 1. Calculates the average score for each student.
# 2. Stores these averages in a new dictionary where the studentâ€™s name is the key and their average score is the value.
# 3. Prints the names of students whose average score is greater than 80.
# Your task is to calculate the average scores for each student and print the names of students 
# whose average score is greater than 80.
#Solution

## Notes to self
#
#print(students[0]['scores']['Math'])
#To access and print Alice's Math score ^


#Part 1
print('Part 1')
